# FEM Project — MATLAB & ABAQUS Analysis

This repository contains a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of a fixed–fixed beam subjected to a static perpendicular load.  
The analysis was performed using:

- **MATLAB** (custom beam stiffness code)
- **ABAQUS/CAE** (2D wire beam model)
- **Analytical Euler–Bernoulli beam theory**

The project includes full documentation, numerical results, and visualizations.

## 🧮 Analytical vs FEM Comparison

The beam was analyzed using classical Euler–Bernoulli relations and simulated using ABAQUS.

### 🔹 **Analytical Results**
- Vertical displacement at midpoint: **1.875 × 10⁻³ m**
- Rotation at right end: **−8.036 × 10⁻³ rad**

(Values extracted from the analytical equations included in the report.)

### 🔹 **ABAQUS FEM Results**
- Vertical displacement at midpoint: **1.887 × 10⁻³ m**
- Rotation at right end: **−8.062 × 10⁻³ rad**

These results show excellent agreement, confirming the correctness of the analytical solution and FEM model.
